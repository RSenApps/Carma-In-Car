        without the hassle of saying each one. Simply say Commute + (name of commute)

        actions just leave the field blank.</string>
    <string name="correction_help">Correction Phrases are a way to change what speech
        recognition interpets. Whenever speech recognition matches your phrase, it will
        automatically be replaced by what you define. A common use for Correction Phrases
        are to fix a common mistake of speech recognition. For example, if it commonly
        mistakes "navigate to ohm" for "navigate to home", then you would create a correction
        phrase of "home->ohm". Correction Phrases can also be used to automatically input
        addresses and contacts. For example "home->1 main street, Seattle" or 
        "Bob->555-555-5555".</string>
